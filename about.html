        <h2>What is 52 Concerts?</h2>
        <p>52 Concerts is the product of a vague project assignment for my
            software engineering summer program. The assignment was to create
            a functioning personal website using the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills
            we have learned so far. I have always felt the best way I can express who I am
            was through talking about music. Music I love, music I hate, music I saw live, 
            what I am listening to these days, and what artists and albums for whom I hold a special reverenence.
            I persoanlly wrote, designed, and coded the whole website. As a novice coder,
            I hope to beautify and add more fucntionality to the site over time.

        <h2>Why is it called 52 Concerts?</h2>
        <p>The first concert I attended was a band called Rogue Wave in 2010. I was 15 at the time and in
            Santa Cruz with a friend's family for spring break. It was a small, intimate show. Near the end,
            they played some somes from their, at the time, new album that incoprated dancier elements than
            their previous albums. The lead singer invited anyone in the crowd to get up on stage and dance
            with the band. My friends and I hopped up and danced out the last two songs, exchanged quick thank
            yous and words of praise for the band and from then on I was officially addicted and to this day
            can never get enough of live music.
        </p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2019, my music obsession still very much in tact. Like many others at the start of
            the year, I was looking for some vague resolution to flimsily commit to. I had already purchased concert
            tickets for ~10 shows. And I thought "wouldn't it be badass if I went to a concert every week?" I regularly
            attend about 30 concerts a year since graduating from college, so ramping up to 50 ish wasn't out of the question.
            Long story short, the following year was truly amazing. Filled with intimate shows, arena shows, festivals,
            spending all of my money, and so much music. I now have a sick stat to use as a fun fact when I need one,
            and it was featured prominantly on my Hinge profile until it attracted the exact girl I wanted to meet and 
            who had the same concert stamina as I do. 
        </p>
        <p>Now 52 concerts is a lot. And people often ask we what counts as a concert. Luckily I had thought of that during my
            epic 2019 and came up with a few simple rules.
            <ol>
                <li>If you paid money to see the band, it counts. If you go to a bar and there is a $10 cover because a band is playing, it counts.</li>
                <li>You must actually watch the performance for at least 45 minutes. If I just drink at the bar and pay no mind to the band, can't count it.</li>
                <li>If I attend some free event or club and they have a DJ, for example; it doesn't count. UNLESS
                    I only showed up <em>beacuse that specific DJ was playing</em>. If I have intention to see that performer; it counts.</li>
                <li>Each day of a festival counts as 1.</li>
                <li>Openers do not count as separate shows</li>
                <li>A show that my band is playing in will only count if I actually watch the full performance of another band. If my band plays and then I leave; doesn't count.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Following these rules, I hit exactly 52. I had to make 1 last minute purchase to make up for a last minute weather cancellation, but I did it.
            It was probably the only new years resolution that I've ever actually completed. If you are an avid concert goer, I highly recommend trying 
            to do a 52 show year. It will be tiring, it will be costly, but if you can do it without jeopardzing yourself financially, it is so so worth it.
            And those that get it, will be in awe, and those that don't, fuck em.
